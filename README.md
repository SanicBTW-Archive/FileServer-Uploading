goofy name ik

this page is used to upload files over to my server (must be localhost, i dont have ssl shit bruh)

currently used in:

- my dumb fnf engine to upload custom songs to play them in the engine
- my dumb music player which hasnt been updated since a few months ago lol

using sancopublic.ddns.net:5430 as the public ip, ngrok as a secure tunnel alternative and pocketbase as my database
